Check out the [analysis.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/greydanus/compton/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) notebook. Should be pretty self-explanatory.

Special thanks to [tegmyr](https://github.com/tegmyr) for the .Chn parser. I took the `read_chn.py` directly from his [ortec_read](https://github.com/tegmyr/ortec_read) repo without modification.
